## Sliding window

Sliding window technique applies to many **subarray/substring** problems.

In this technique, there are usually 2 pointers moving in the same direction.

**Time complexity - O(n)**

How to recognise which problems can be solved using sliding window technique?

- things we iterate over **_sequentially (contiguous sequence of elements)_**
- strings, arrays, linked lists
- calculating min, max of something, longest, shortest, contained charactersâ€¦
